"""Console-script entry point for the ``moonshine-voice`` package.

Installed as the ``moonshine-voice`` and ``moonshine`` commands via the
``[project.scripts]`` table in ``pyproject.toml``. This is a thin dispatcher:
each subcommand runs the corresponding module's existing ``__main__`` demo, so
``moonshine-voice mic --language en`` is equivalent to the long-standing
``python -m moonshine_voice.mic_transcriber --language en``. Argument parsing,
help text, and behaviour therefore live entirely in the individual modules and
stay identical between the two invocation styles.
